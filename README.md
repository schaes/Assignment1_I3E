#Bugs
-	UI when collecting keycard or gasmask doesn’t go away when collected
  
#Note
- There are no complicated puzzles however should you get stuck on certain jumps please do note that you are supposed to push the dark grey blocks to allow you to make the jumps that are impossible. 
- Also, for the room with the poisonous gas you need to collect the gas mask to not take damage from in the gas
